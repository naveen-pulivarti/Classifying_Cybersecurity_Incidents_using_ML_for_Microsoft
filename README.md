# Classifying_Cybersecurity_Incidents_using_ML_for_Microsoft
Machine learning project for SOCs to classify cybersecurity incidents using the GUIDE dataset. Predicts triage grades (TP, BP, FP) with a focus on data preprocessing, model evaluation (macro-F1, precision, recall), and feature engineering. Supports automated threat detection and response, improving SOC accuracy and efficiency.
